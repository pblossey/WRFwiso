---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key options:

if you wish to use fractional sea ice, please set fractional_seaice = 1
 in the physics section of namelist input.

"seaice_thickness" can also be set the physics section of namelist input
if you have allowed for the variable sea ice thickness option. 
In that case set seaice_thickness = 1 		(this is an enabling flag)

compiler options:

#define BPRC_SI_DEPTH - allows variable sea ice thickness as an option
	- connected with variables SITHIK (sea ice thickness in meters)
	  and SNOWSI (snow depth on sea ice in meters). If you use this
	  option the sea ice thickness and snow depth must be specified/input
	  in some way. The new code in the WPS subdirectory has the capability of 
	  generating such files for the Arctic. For the Arctic System Reanalysis, 
	  Bill Chapman of UIUC has created a 2000-2008 history of sea ice
	  age and thickness that may serve as a climatogical input for 
      	  sea ice thickness. The ASR also plans a climatological treatment
	  of Arctic Ocean snow thickness based upon Warren et al. (1999). 
	  Sea ice thickness is currently held to the range 0.1 to 10 m. The
	  minimum thickness may be increased to 0.25 for the multi-layer ASR.
	  Snow depth on sea ice currently ranges is 0.001 to 1 m.
		default is option off 

#define BPRC_SEAICE
	Adds to the fractional sea ice option in module_physics_init.F.
        It also sets the seasonal sea ice albedo in module_sf_noahlsm.F
	You should set the sea ice albedo appropriate for an Arctic winter,
	Arctic summer, or Antarctic case. You should manually set the
	sea ice albedo if this is not done by other options. 0.82 is good
	for the Arctic cold months. 0.65 is good for bare ice in Arctic summer
	0.50 may be good for a mid-summer mix of bare ice and melt ponds.
		default is option on

#define BPRC_SI_TEMPERATURE (Soil initialization - module_soil_pre.F)
	Only use input xice/seaice variable to define sea ice locations.
	Otherwise TSK (skin temperature) can be used to determine 
	where sea ice is.
		default is option on

#define EXTREME_CHECK (Noah LSM driver)
 	This option enables checks on reasonable value ranges for 
	model variables such as T1 (surface temperature), PSFC 
	(surface pressure), and STC (soil temperature). This is
	a holdover from Polar WRF 3.0.1 and now put as an option.
		default is option off

#define ICEZO_SMALL (Noah LSM driver and Noah LSM)
	This option reduces the surface roughness (Z0, ZNT, and Z0BRD) 
	to 0.1 mm over permanent ice.
		default is option off

#define SEAICE_FREEZE (Noah LSM driver)
	This option changes to base subsurface temperature for 
	sea ice from 271.16 K to 271.36 K (-1.8 C).
		default is option on

#define BPRC_POLAR (Noah LSM and surface driver)
	This option sets snow emissivity to 0.98. It also reduces
	the maximum snow thickness over permanent ice to "DSOIL" for 	
	purpose of calculating ground heat flux for permanent ice.
	A new addition to Polar WRF 3.2 is a wrapper routine for 
	the MYNN surface layer of the PBL. This enables the MYNN
	surface atmospheric layer scheme to run separately for 
	the ice and liquid components of pack ice grid points, similar
	to those for the MYJ and YSU surface layer atmospheric schemes.
		default is option on

#define SNOW_DEPTH_5CM (Noah LSM)
#define SI_DEPTH_3M (Noah LSM)
	These options set the sea ice depth and the snow depth on 
	sea ice to the Noah standard values of 3 m and 5 cm, respectively.
	This mimics standard Noah with the sea ice thickness option
	turned on. Do not use if you wish to specify your own variable
	sea ice thickness and snow.
		default is option on
	
#define ORGANIC_TUNDRA (Noah LSM)
	This option sets the thermal conductivity for the upper soil
	layer to 0.25 W m-2 K-1 for Tundra (landuse 20, 21, 22, or 23)
	prior to any averaging with snow thermal conductivity. The
	motivation for this option is Mike Barlage's work with Noah
	in preparation for the Arctic System Reanalysis and the Hines et al. 
	(2010) test of Polar WRF 3.0.1.1 for Arctic land. A peat or "organic"
	layer seems to work well for the soil type along the North Slope 
	of Alaska. The effect there is too reduce the conductivity by an order
	of magnitude resulting in warmer winter soil temperatures, cooler 
	summer soil temperatures, slightly colder atmospheric temperatures
	during winter, and reduced ground heat flux. I don't know how well 
	this works for other Arctic environments. 
		default is option off

#define ALTERNATE_SFCT (Noah LSM)
	This option now lets the user decide to use Polar WRF's 
	method based upon direct calculation of the surface 
	energy balance .. or the classic WRF method for determining
	the surface temperature over snow in SUBROUTINE SNOPAC.
	Previously, it was found that that the Polar WRF direct
	calculation produced better results over Greenland and
	Antarctic ice sheets (option on). Which method produces better 
 	results over sea ice and Arctic land is uncertain. User's may 
	wish to test with the option on and off for best results in
	their cases. (This may be an important question).
	Only surface temperature over snow is impacted.
		default is option off

#define ALBEDO_CICE (Noah LSM)
	Old option for setting the seasonal variation of Arctic sea ice albedo.
	No longer supported.
		default is option off

#define ALBEDO_SI (Noah LSM, Noah driver, physics initialization, start_em.F, module_first_rk_step_part1.F, and surface driver)
	Option to enable setting the sea ice albedo from the input (WPS).
	Requires a 2D file in the input. Will be employed for the ASR.
	There is now code in the WPS subdirectory to set this for the Arctic.
		default is option off

#define BPRC_ALBSI (Noah LSM, Noah driver, physics initialization, module_first_rk_step_part1.F, and surface driver)
	Similar to ALBEDO_SI option, however sets the sea ice albedo based 
	specifications in subroutines that run in the first timestep. Older 
	option than ALBEDO_SI.
		default is option off

#define LIMIT_SNOW_10CM (Noah LSM)
	Limits the full implementation of BPRC_SI_DEPTH. Tests of Polar WRF 3.2
	for the January 1998 (winter) SHEBA case show that that implementation of 
	Warren et al.'s (1999) BPRC_SI_DEPTH often puts more than 20 cm of snow
	on the Arctic Ocean sea ice. This was found to produce a cold bias at SHEBA.
	Consequently, this option limits maximum snow depth to 10 cm, producing reasonable
	results at SHEBA. This option does not limit the minimum snow thickness. 
	The physics behind the heat flux through sea ice and snow is therefore
	suggested to require additional investigation.
		default is option on

#define LIMIT_SEAICE_25CM (Noah LSM, Noah driver, module_soil_pre.F.PWRF3.2)
	A miminum limit for sea ice thickness put in place for the (additional) 
	multi-subsurface-layer Arctic System Reanalysis. Prevents ice layers from
	becoming too thin.
		default is option off

In summary, key features include the possibility of variable
sea ice thickness and variable snow cover on sea ice, which now have a
plausible input for the Arctic through auxillary WPS programs. Arctic 
sea ice thickness is available from Bill Chapman's 6.25 km (25 km) resolution 
dataset for 2002-2008 (2000-2002). The seasonal evolution of 
Arctic sea ice albedo can also be input through auxillary WPS programs. 
The evolution is based upon a prescribed seasonal cycle modulated
by Mark Anderson's snow melt on sea ice data. The MYNN PBL's surface 
atmospheric layer can now be fully integrated with the frational sea ice.
Similar to the MYJ and YSU schemes, it can be run twice for the ice and
liquid components of pack ice grid points. The QNSE PBL's surface layer
scheme does not yet have that option. It runs only once with the average
of ice and liquid characteristics for sea ice points. 
SITHIK, SNOWSI and ALBSI are 2D fields are produced in the running of real.exe
if the appropriate options are enabled. These fields will be added to the 
WRF output. We also suggest users consider the ORGANIC_TUNDRA
option if that is appropriate for the soil in your domain, 
and for users to experiment with ALTERNATE_SFCT.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:

The in file "module_mp_morr_two_moment.F" (not included here) is normally set 
for typical id-latitude CCN values. The parameter INUC can be set at 0
(mid-latitude aerosols) or 1 (M-PACE study - Oct. 2004, clean atmosphere).

The subdirectory WPS section includes an optional feature for inputing
NSIDC sea ice (AMSR-E, bootstrap, and AMSR-E/SSMI from Chapman) through 
the WPS preprocessing.

You may wish to edit the parameter tables "LANDUSE.TBL" and "VEGPARM.TBL" to
better reflect the surface values of quantities such as seasonal albedo and
emissitivy for your study.

WRF3.1.1 (and later versions) have improved snow albedo compared to earlier 
versions. 

Tests suggest that Polar WRF 3.1.1 simulations have colder near-surface
atmospheric temperatures and smaller magnitude ground heat fluxes
for mid-winter cases in comparison to Polar WRF 3.0.1.1.

These routines are designed for WRF version 3.2 If you try to use them  
with another version of WRF you are likely to run into incompatibility 
problems.

As a favor, we ask that you reference the journal articles on Polar WRF in 
your publications that make use of Polar WRF. We would also like to hear from 
users of Polar WRF on the basic plans for the model's use.  Comments on 
the applicability and results of Polar WRF are encouraged, as user input 
helps improve the product. If you have improvements for Polar WRF, please 
share them so we can all benefit in a sense of a community model.

Testing of Polar WRF 3.2 has suggested the following:

Winter and summer temperatures are reasonable over the Arctic Ocean
during summer and winter and along the North Slope of Alaska. 

There is a warm bias for near surface temperature during winter over Greenland.

Realistic simulation of near surface temperature requires a reduction in the
summer albedo over Greenland. An albedo of 0.835 is a typical observed value.

The diurnal cycle of summer temperature of Greenland is larger than that 
observed.

There is a dry bias in the near surface atmosphere.

A negative near-surface wind speed bias with earlier versions of Polar WRF
is not found in tests of Polar WRF 3.2. There may be a slight positive bias
now.

The YSU PBL does not give good results.

The RRTMG radiation schemes give the best results. It has been suggested,
however, that version 3.2 has some issues in the upper atmosphere. Stay 
tuned for further developments.

The MYNN and QNSE PBL schemes may be slight improvements over
the MYJ scheme.

More study may be required of the heat transfer through sea ice and
associated surface energy balance. Use of the Warren et al (1999) 
climatological snow on sea ice dataset is not recommended at this time.

Pending are tests over Anatctica and implementation into AMPS, along with
additional ASR testing.
