Key options:

if you wish to use fractional sea ice, please set fractional_seaice = 1
 in the physics section of namelist input.

"seaice_thickness" can also be set the physics section of namelist input
if you have allowed for the variable sea ice thickness option. 
In that case set seaice_thickness = 1 		(this is an enabling flag)

compiler options:

#define BPRC_SI_DEPTH - allows variable sea ice thickness as an option
	- connected with new variables SITHIK (sea ice thickness in meters)
	  and SNOWSI (snow depth on sea ice in meters). If you use this
	  option the sea ice thickness and snow depth must be specified/input
	  in some way. For the Arctic System Reanalysis, Bill Chapman of 
	  UIUC and Jim Maslanik of NSIDC are creating a history of
	  sea ice age and thickness that may serve as a climatogical 
      	  input for sea ice thickness. The ASR also plans a climatological
	  treatment of snow thickness. Sea ice thickness range is 0.1 to 10 m.
	  Snow depth on sea ice range is 0.001 to 1 m.

#define BPRC_SEAICE
	Adds to the fractional sea ice option in module_physics_init.F.
        It also sets the seasonal sea ice albedo in module_sf_noahlsm.F
	You should set the sea ice albedo appropriate for an Arctic winter,
	Arctic summer, or Antarctic case.

#define BPRC_SI_TEMPERATURE (Soil initialization - module_soil_pre.F)
	Only use input xice/seaice variable to define sea ice locations.
	Otherwise tsk (skin temperature) can be used to determine 
	  where sea ice is.

#define EXTREME_CHECK (Noah LSM driver)
 	This option enables checks on reasonable value ranges for 
	model variables such as T1 (surface temperature), PSFC 
	(surface pressure), and STC (soil temperature). This is
	a holdover from Polar WRF 3.0.1 and now put as an option.
	This option is turned off as a default.

#define ICEZO_SMALL (Noah LSM driver and Noah LSM)
	This option reduces the surface roughness (Z0, ZNT, and Z0BRD) 
	to 0.1 mm over permanent ice. This option is turned off as a default.

#define SEAICE_FREEZE (Noah LSM driver)
	This option changes to base subsurface temperature for 
	sea ice from 271.16 K to 271.36 K (-1.8 C).

#define BPRC_POLAR (Noah LSM)
	This option sets snow emissivity to 0.98. It also reduces
	the maximum snow thickness to "DSOIL" for purpose of calculating
	ground heat flux for permanent ice.

#define SNOW_DEPTH_5CM (Noah LSM)
#define SI_DEPTH_3M (Noah LSM)
	These options set the sea ice depth and the snow depth on 
	sea ice to the Noah standard values of 3 m and 5 cm, respectively.
	This mimics standard Noah with the sea ice thickness option
	turned on. Do not use if you wish to specify your own variable
	sea ice thickness and snow.
	
#define ORGANIC_TUNDRA (Noah LSM)
	This option sets the thermal conductivity for the upper soil
	layer to 0.25 W m-2 K-1 for Tundra (landuse 20, 21, 22, or 23)
	prior to any averaging with snow thermal conductivity. The
	motivation for this option is Mike Barlage's work with Noah
	in preparation for the Arctic System Reanalysis. An "organic"
	layer seems to work well for the North Slope of Alaska. The
	effect there is too reduce the conductivity by an order of
	magnitude resulting in warmer winter soil temperatures,
	slightly colder atmospheric temperatures, and reduced 
	ground heat flux. I don't know how well this works in 
	other Arctic environments. This option is turned off as
	a default.

#define NOPHASE_PERMICE (Noah LSM)
	An option to turn off the thermodynamic effects of phase
	change in permanent ice. Inspired by model results finding
	temperature change in Antarctic ice due to questionable phase
	change. This option is currently inactive and inert.

#define ALTERNATE_SFCT (Noah LSM)
	This option now lets the user decide to use Polar WRF 3.0.1's 
	method based upon direct calculation of the surface 
	energy balance .. or the classic WRF method for determining
	the surface temperature over snow in SUBROUTINE SNOPAC.
	Previously, it was found that that the Polar WRF direct
	calculation produced better results over Greenland and
	Antarctic ice sheets (option on). Which method produces better 
 	results over sea ice and Arctic land is uncertain. User's may 
	wish to test with the option on and off for best results in
	their cases. (This may be an important question).
	Only surface temperature over snow is impacted.

In summary, the key "new" features are the possibility of variable
sea ice thickness and variable snow cover on sea ice. However, the
use of these options currently requires non-trivial user input. 
SITHIK and SNOWSI 2D fields are produced in the running of real.exe
if the option is enabled. It's plausible to input these fields with
modifications to WPS preprocessing. We also suggest users consider
the ORGANIC_TUNDRA option if that is appropriate for your domain, 
and for users to experiment with ALTERNATE_SFCT.

Notes:

The file "module_mp_morr_two_moment.F.PWRF3.1.1" is only there for
applications when you wish to change from the current mid-latitude
settings to the clean-atmosphere setting from the M-PACE study. The
option MPACE (currently turned off) only changes the paramter INUC
from 0 (mid-latitude) to 1 (M-PACE, clean atmosphere).

The subdirectory WPS section includes an optional feature for inputing
NSIDC sea ice through the WPS preprocessing.

You may wish to edit the parameter tables "LANDUSE.TBL" and "VEGPARM.TBL" to
better reflect the surface values of quantities such as seasonal albedo and
emissitivy for your study.

WRF3.1.1 should have improved snow albedo compared to earlier versions
of WRF. The ability to generate an improved seasonal snow albedo cycle
would be an important improvement over the earlier generic specification. 
However, such improvement is something that probably needs to be demonstrated
in actual simulations.

Tests suggest that Polar WRF 3.1.1 simulations have colder near-surface
atmospheric temperatures and smaller magnitude ground heat fluxes
for mid-winter cases in comparison to Polar WRF 3.0.1.1.

These routines are designed for WRF version 3.1.1. If you try to use them  
with another version of WRF you are likely to run into incompatibility 
problems.

As a favor, we ask that you reference the journal articles on Polar WRF in 
your publications that make use of Polar WRF. We would also like to hear from 
users of Polar WRF on the basic plans for the model's use.  Comments on 
the applicability and results of Polar WRF are encouraged, as user input 
helps improve the product. If you have improvements for Polar WRF, please 
share them so we can all benefit in a sense of a community model.
